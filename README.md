Improvements/Enhancements in progress: 
- Time Series Analysis/XGBoost to get better results
- More effective standardization
- Updating player biodata after NBA 2024 Free Agency
- Feature engineering (injuries, home/away, clutch stats, schedule strength)
- Visualizations for the predicted stats for all 30 NBA teams
- Final Report focusing on the Milwaukee Bucks and other NBA teams
